<h4>Objective: I am actively looking out for Mechanical Engineering positions requiring expertise in Thermal and Fluid Sciences.</h4>
<hr>
<h3><u>Summary</u></h3>
<p>I completed my Masters in Mechanical Engineering at Clemson University with a focus on Thermal and Fluid Sciences. During the course of my graduate degree I  have acquired experience in applying complex CFD models and validating them, working in a High Performance Computing environment and coding using Python and FORTRAN.
During my Master’s research, I used CFD software and codes to simulate electro-kinetic instabilities in microchannels. I validated my CFD models with experimental data that I collected on in-house fabricated channels. Throughout my Master’s experience, I have efficiently and creatively solved challenging problems. I am very eager to apply my skills to new and diverse research questions.
My software skills include creating Multiphysics models in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), shell scripting with BASH to automate tasks, coding in FORTRAN and Python for data analysis and CFD codes, and working in a Linux-based High Performance Computing environment which included compiling software from source code. I am formally trained in numerical modeling and statistical techniques via coursework in Computational Methods in Thermal and Fluid Sciences, Finite Element Analysis and Statistics.</p>
